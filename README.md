Conventional strategies in tackling issues related to guidance and generalized trajectory planning largely pinpoint trajectories that enhance an objective function, commonly tied to the reduction of travel time. Yet, the existence of environmental flows, like oceanic currents or winds, presents further complexity to these strategies. This study offers a novel method to discern efficient routes in environments influenced by flows. Instead of purely focusing on reducing travel time, the proposed scheme takes into account the effect of flows on the trajectory, aiming for solutions that leverage these environmental forces to optimize motion.
